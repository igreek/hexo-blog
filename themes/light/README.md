# Lightum

This is the theme I currently use for [Hexo](http://hexo.io/). It is based on [Light](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-light). See my blog as a [Demo](http://blog.greekw.com/).

For clarity, I leave all my settings unchanged. So you are suggested to modify the theme as you need.

## Install

Execute the following command and modify `theme` in `_config.yml` to `lightum`.

```
git clone https://github.com/zippera/lightum.git themes/lightum
```

## Update

Execute the following command to update Light.

```
cd themes/lightum
git pull
```

## Customization

- **About**: . Edit this file to add your information. 
- **Intro**: Go to `layout/_widget/intro.ejs` and add your information.
- **Weibo**: Go to `layout/_widget/weibo.ejs` and add your weibo configuration.
- **Fork me on Github**: Go to `layout/layout.ejs` and change the Github username to yours. Replace the src URL of the `<img>` with your own, which I recommend qiniu or the `source` dir under the `hexo` dir.
